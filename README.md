# Online Payment Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

The introduction of online payment systems has revolutionized the way we make payments, making transactions more convenient and accessible. However, it has also led to an increase in online payment fraud. Detecting and preventing online payment fraud is crucial, especially for credit card companies, to protect customers from unauthorized charges and ensure the security of online transactions. This project focuses on using machine learning with Python to detect and classify online payment fraud, ultimately enhancing the security of online payments.

## Introduction

Online payment fraud can happen to anyone using various payment systems, particularly when using credit cards for transactions. To combat this issue, machine learning provides an effective approach to identify fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. This project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions. We will use this dataset to train a machine learning model to predict online payment fraud.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **step**: Represents a unit of time where 1 step equals 1 hour.
- **type**: Denotes the type of online transaction.
- **amount**: Specifies the amount of the transaction.
- **nameOrig**: Identifies the customer initiating the transaction.
- **oldbalanceOrg**: Indicates the balance before the transaction for the customer.
- **newbalanceOrig**: Reflects the balance after the transaction for the customer.
- **nameDest**: Identifies the recipient of the transaction.
- **oldbalanceDest**: Represents the initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.
- **newbalanceDest**: Displays the new balance of the recipient after the transaction.
- **isFraud**: A binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system, along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- jupyter notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter Notebook)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd online-payment-fraud-detection
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided (online_payment_fraud_detection.ipynb) to see the step-by-step implementation and analysis.

4. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning model for online payment fraud detection.

## Conclusion

Detecting online payment fraud is essential to ensure the security and trustworthiness of online transactions. This project provides a practical example of how to use machine learning with Python to identify and classify fraudulent online payments. By analyzing historical transaction data, you can build a model that helps protect customers from fraudulent activities. Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the code and analysis.
